This module provides [Material-UI][material-ui] `<SvgIcon />` components for all
[Material Design Icons][md-icons]. This is pretty handy if you use React and Material-UI
to build a web app and run out of icons.

While this module contains wrappers for all icons, alias names are not included. For example, the _plus_ icon is aliased as _add_, but only the _plus_ icon
is exported.

## Installation
```shell
npm install mdi-material-ui --save
```

## Usage
Every icon is exported with its original name in PascalCase. So `coffee` becomes `Coffee`,
`cloud-print-outline` is exported as `CloudPrintOutline` and so on.

### With tree-shaking
If your environment supports tree-shaking and you are sure that it works fine in your setup, you can simply import the icons as follows:

```js
import { Coffee, Food } from 'mdi-material-ui'
```

### Without tree-shaking
If your environment doesn't support tree-shaking, you should only import the icons that you actually need in order to ensure that you don't end up bundling _all_ icons.
  
```js
import Coffee from 'mdi-material-ui/Coffee'
import Food from 'mdi-material-ui/Food'
```

If you think that this is far too verbose (I agree!), consider using [babel-plugin-direct-import](https://github.com/umidbekkarimov/babel-plugin-direct-import). Install it and adjust your `.babelrc` by adding the following snippet to the plugins section:

```js
{
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    ["direct-import", ["mdi-material-ui"]]
  ]
}
```
